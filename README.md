# Cancer_Bioinformatics (#Issue 1)
This markdown file consists of my own practice with DLBCL dataset to elucidate genetic susceptibility of this cancer towards ibrutinib
In this code, I tried to familiarize with basic analysis of Differential Expression Genes, correlation analysis, heatmap clustering, and gene set enrichment analysis

# Cancer_Bioinformatics (#Issue 2)

In this code, I try to familiarize myself with doing meta-analysis into two microarray datasets and find the best potential genes that share in common for both in differentiating two classes of phenotypes.  Basically, I use MetaIntegrator for performing meta-analysis in such a high throughput dataset. Also provided in this code are two types of forest plots using different packages.
